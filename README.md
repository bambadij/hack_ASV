# Eutum Ligguey - job posting website 

"Eutum Ligguey" is a job website but with something a little different. There will be a system of milestones for individuals to balance their personal and professional life/development.. This repository contains the source code and development history of the "Eutum Ligguey" platform.

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `backend/`: This directory contains the backend code of the "Eutum Ligguey" platform, including the API endpoints, database models, and business logic implemented in Python using the Django framework.
- `frontend/`: This directory contains the frontend code for the "Eutum Ligguey" platform, including templates in HTML, stylings in CSS, and page responsiveness in Java and Javascript. 

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a collaborative space for development and improvement of the "Eutum Ligguey" platform. By making the repository publicly accessible, we aim to foster community engagement, allowing developers, contributors, and users to explore the codebase, report issues, and suggest enhancements.

## How Generative AI Models are Solving the Problem
“Eutum Ligguey” leverages generative AI models to improve the functionality of the platform, particularly in the area of visual question answering (VQA). The chosen generative AI models, such as the “dandelin/vilt-b32-finetuned-vqa” model, were fine-tuned to process and interpret images containing user questions. These models use cutting-edge computer vision and natural language processing techniques to generate accurate and meaningful answers to user queries.

By integrating generative AI models into Eutum Ligguey", we enable users to ask questions about content, such as diagrams, images or screenshots, and receive relevant answers. This significantly improves the learning experience, as users can get detailed explanations, information or clarifications about the resources they interact with. It opens new possibilities for interactive and dynamic learning, making Eutum Ligguey" a powerful platform for sharing and acquisition of work.
